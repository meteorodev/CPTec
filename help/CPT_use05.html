<H2>Constructing the Model</H2>
Once all the fields have been defined correctly, it is now possible to perform the analysis. Select the 
<A HREF="Actions.html">Actions</A> menu item, and then choose between <A HREF="Actions_CV.html">cross-validated</A> and 
<A HREF="Actions_Retro.html">retroactive</A> forecasts. The retroactive option will produce the same cross-validated forecasts 
as the cross-validated option in addition to the retroactive forecasts, but while producing more results, does take longer to 
run. If the retroactive option is selected, the length of the initial training period and the frequency with which the model is 
updated must be defined. The default is for the initial training period to be half the full training period, and for the model 
to be updated every year.<P>

Once the cross-validated or retroactive option has been selected, the console in the window indicates the program's current 
actions and progress. At the top of the console is a Progress Meter that indicates approximately how far the program has 
progressed with its current calculations. It is not possible to access any of the results until the Progress Meter indicates 
that the task is complete. The progress meter will run from 0% to 100% four times: the first time as CPT reads the data from 
the Y and X input files (CPT reads the Y input file first); the second time as CPT identifies and replaces missing values, the
third time as CPT calculates climatologies and thresholds, and the fouth time when it is performing the calculations. Beneath 
the Meter is a list of Actions. When calculations are complete the Actions list will indicate "Done!" The Actions list also 
indicates progress in finding the optimum number(s) of modes if the optimization option is activated (depending upon the 
maximum and minimum numbers of X, Y and CCA modes). In the left columns the current number(s) of modes is indicated together 
with a "goodness of fit index". The right columns store the optimal number(s) of modes and goodness of fit index, defined as 
the number(s) of modes with the highest goodness of fit index.<P>
