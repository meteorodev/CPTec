<H2>CCA Maps</H2>
The CCA maps (or bar charts if the data are unreferenced) show similar results to the <A HREF="Tools_Modes_XEOF.html">Loadings 
and Scores</A>, but show the weights for the X and Y components of the CCA modes together. The corresponding temporal scores on 
the centre graph (the red line is for the X variables, and the green line is for the Y variables). It is the correlation 
between the curves shown on this central graph that CCA attempts to maximize. The canonical correlation is a function partly of 
any relationships between the X and Y data that CPT exploits to make predictions, but also partly a function of the numbers of 
X modes retained. Thus the canonical correlation can be artificially inflated simply by forcing CPT to retain a large number of 
modes. High canonical correlations should not necessarily be interpreted as a sign of a good predictive model.<P>

The weights and scores for different CCA modes can be displayed using the control at the top left of the CCA maps window, but, 
unlike the <A HREF="Tools_Modes_XEOF.html">X</A> and <A HREF="Tools_Modes_YEOF.html">Y modes</A>, only those CCA modes that CPT 
retains can be viewed. The results can be saved to an output file from the <B>CCA Results</B> tab in 
<A HREF="File_OutputResults.html">File ~ Output Results</A>, but the actual weights are saved rather than the correlations 
between the original gridded / station / index data and the temporal scores for the corresponding X and Y components of the CCA 
modes.<P>

The graphics can be saved as individually or as a montage as BMP, EMF, GIF, JPEG, PCX or PNG files by right-clicking anywhere 
in the child window, and then selecting the desired graphic to be saved from <B>Export</B>. A default name is given to the 
file, but this name can be changed using the browse button. The quality of the JPEG file can be adjusted using the slider or by 
the quality indicator, which ranges between 0.01 and 1.00. The highest quality is obtained using 1.00. The size of the JPEG 
file is affected by the quality chosen, with larger files being generated the higher the selected quality. The image quality 
for all the graphics formats can be improved by increasing the size of the image (see 
<A HREF="Options_Graphics_GrphScaling.html">Options ~ Graphics ~ Graph Scaling</A>).<P>

The map and graph titles can be set using the <B>Customise</B> option upon right-clicking in the child window. There is some 
flexibility to adjust the colour scaling on the maps: the colour bar limits can be set by right-clicking on the image and then 
selecting the <B>Customise ~ Contour Limits</B> option. A window opens that indicates the assumed maximum and minimum data 
values when setting the colour intervals and number of colours. These values can be reset, which will in turn automatically 
reset the colour interval and number of colours. Similarly, the y-axis limits on the graph can be set by right-clicking on 
the image and then selecting the <B>Customise ~ Y-Axis Limits</B> option. Resetting these axis limits will in turn 
automatically reset the tick-mark interval and number of tick marks. Greater flexibility for setting the colour scaling and 
tick marks is planned for future releases. Further options for customizing the maps and graphs are available from 
<A HREF="Options_Graphics.html">Options ~ Graphics</A>.<P>
