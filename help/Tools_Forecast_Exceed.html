<H2>Exceedance Probabilities</H2>
The exceedance probabilities indicate the probability that the value on the <i>x</i>-axis will be exceeded. The exceedance 
probabilities are calculated using the climatological data (see <A HREF="Options_ClimatologicalPeriod.html">Climatological 
Period</A> for details on setting the climatological period.) and are shown by the thick red line, as well as by a smoothed 
thin red line that represents a normal distribution fit to the data. (If the <A HREF="Options_Data_Transform.html">Transform Y 
Data</A> option is switched on the fitted distribution will not be smooth, but it will not be stepped either). The 
probabilities indicated by the green curve are calculated using the current forecast. The values on the <i>x</i>-axis can be 
shown as anomalies, standardized anomalies of % of average (if the <A HREF="Options_Data_Zero.html">Zero Bound</A> option is 
switched on) by selecting the appropriate standarization option from the <A HREF="Options_Customize.html">Customize</A> menu 
item. The shading and vertical dashed lines show the thresholds for the "above" and below" categories.<P>
 
If more than one forecast is produced, the forecasts can be cycled using the up and down arrows (which will work better than 
attempting to type in the year, although CPT occasionally loses track of the year if they are cycled through too quickly). 
Similarly, the curves for different gridpoints / stations / series can be viewed by setting the appropriate number at the 
prompt. A series that has been omitted in the calculations will be skipped.<P>

The forecasts can be saved by right-clicking anywhere in the child window. Similarly, the graph itself can be saved as a BMP, 
EMF, GIF, JPEG, PCX, or PNG file by right-clicking and selecting <B>Export</B>. A default name is given to the graphic file, 
but this name can be changed using the browse button. The quality of the JPEG file can be adjusted using the slider or by the 
quality indicator, which ranges between 0.01 and 1.00. The highest quality is obtained using 1.00. The size of the JPEG file is 
affected by the quality chosen, with larger files being generated the higher the selected quality. The image quality for all 
the graphics formats can be improved by increasing the size of the image (see 
<A HREF="Options_Graphics_GrphScaling.html">Options ~ Graphics ~ Graph Scaling</A>). The graphic title can be set using the 
<B>Customise</B> option upon right-clicking in the child window.<P>

The y-axis limits can be set by right-clicking on the image and then selecting the <B>Customise ~ Y-Axis Limits</B> option. The 
maximum and minimum values on the y-axis are indicated and can be reset. Resetting these axis limits will in turn automatically 
reset the tick-mark interval and number of tick marks. Greater flexibility for setting the tick marks is planned for future 
releases. Further options for customizing the graph, including adjusting the size of the fonts, and the size of the images, are 
available from <A HREF="Options_Graphics.html">Options ~ Graphics</A>.<P>
