<H2>Attributes Diagrams</H2>
The attributes diagrams are constructed using probabilistic retroactive forecasts. Results are shown separately for the three 
categories, and for all the categories pooled together (top left). The reliability statistics are calculated using predictions 
for all gridpoints / stations / series. By default, the probabilistic forecasts are binned to the nearest 10% (in accordance 
with the <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/wmo/lrfvs/Attachment_II-8.doc" class=link>WMO's Standardized Verification System for 
Long-Range Forecasts (SVSLRF)</a>, but 5% probability bins can be selected using <A HREF="Options_Verification.html">Options ~ 
Verification Settings</A>. Even though the forecast probabilities are binned, the point on the 
<i>x</i>-axis is shown at the average of the forecasts in the bin rather than at the centre of the bin. Similarly, the 
resolution slopes are calculated using the actual forecast probabilities (not binned), as are the Brier and ranked probability 
scores. (The Brier and ranked probability scores can be calculated using forecast probabilities at the central point of the bin 
using <A HREF="Options_Verification.html">Options ~ Verification Settings</A>.)<P>

The reliability curve is shown by the thick line, while the solid 45 degree diagonal shows the line of perfect reliability. 
The dashed diagonal is the so-called no-skill line (a reliability curve that is shallower than this will score a negative 
Brier skill score against climatology). The horizontal line represents the line of no resolution and crosses the <i>y</i>-axis 
at the observed relative frequency for all years. Note that his value is not necessarily the same as the climatological 
probability of an event since the observed relative frequency is defined only over th retroactive period.<P>

The reliability statistics can be saved by right-clicking on the graphs. In a similar manner the graphs themselves can be saved 
and the titles customised. The graphs can be saved individually or as a montage as a BMP, EMF, GIF, JPEG, PCX, or PNG file by 
right-clicking anywhere in the child window and selecting <B>Export</B>. A default name is given to the graphic file, but this 
name can be changed using the browse button. The quality of the JPEG file can be adjusted using the slider or by the quality 
indicator, which ranges between 0.01 and 1.00. The highest quality is obtained using 1.00. The size of the JPEG file is 
affected by the quality chosen, with larger files being generated the higher the selected quality. The image quality for all 
the graphics formats can be improved by increasing the size of the image (see 
<A HREF="Options_Graphics_GrphScaling.html">Options ~ Graphics ~ Graph Scaling</A>). The graphic titles can be set using the 
<B>Customise</B> option upon right-clicking in the child window. Further options for customizing the graphs, including 
adjusting the size of the fonts, and the size of the images are available from <A HREF="Options_Graphics.html">Options ~ 
Graphics</A>.<P>
