<H2>Ranked-Hits Diagram</H2>
The ranked-hits diagram shows the relative frequency of occurrence of the category with the highest, second highest, and 
lowest forecast probabilities, for each time step.<P>

The scores can be saved by right-clicking on the graphs. Similarly, the graphic can be saved as a BMP, EMF, GIF, JPEG, PCX, or 
PNG file by right-clicking anywhere in the child window. A default name is given to the graphic file, but this name can be 
changed using the browse button. The quality of the JPEG file can be adjusted using the slider or by the quality indicator, 
which ranges between 0.01 and 1.00. The highest quality is obtained using 1.00. The size of the JPEG file is affected by the 
quality chosen, with larger files being generated the higher the selected quality. The image quality for all the graphics 
formats can be improved by increasing the size of the image (see <A HREF="Options_Graphics_GrphScaling.html">Options ~ Graphics 
~ Graph Scaling</A>).<P>

The scores can be saved by right-clicking on the graphs. In a similar manner the graph itself can be saved and the title 
customised. The graph can be saved as a BMP, EMF, GIF, JPEG, PCX, or PNG file by right-clicking anywhere in the child window. A 
default name is given to the graphic file, but this name can be changed using the browse button. The quality of the JPEG file

obtained using 1.00. The size of the JPEG file is affected by the quality chosen, with larger files being generated the higher 
the selected quality. The image quality for all the graphics formats can be improved by increasing the size of the image 
(see <A HREF="Options_Graphics_GrphScaling.html">Options ~ Graphics ~ Graph Scaling</A>). The graphic title can be set using 
the <B>Customise</B> option upon right-clicking in the child window. Further options for customizing the graph, including 
adjusting the size of the fonts, and the size of the image are available from <A HREF="Options_Graphics.html">Options ~ 
Graphics</A>.<P>
