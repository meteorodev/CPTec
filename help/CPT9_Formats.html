<H2>Old File Formats</H2>
Old CPT file formats can be read by CPT10. Their structure is simpler than the new formats, and so some users may prefer to
continue to use the old format.<P>

<B>Gridded</B> data files must be structured such that columns represent longitudes, and rows represent latitudes. The date, 
the latitudes and the longitudes must also be provided. The first row of data must indicate the date of the first record in the 
format dd mmm yyyy, followed by the longitudes. The second record must contain the latitude followed by the data. Latitudes 
must be represented as betweeen 90 and -90, with negative values indicating latitudes in the southern hemisphere. It is more 
slightly efficient to order the latitudes from north to south, but the reverse ordering can be used. Longitudes must be 
represented as values between -180 and +360, with negative values indicating longitudes in the western hemisphere, and the 
longitudes must be ordered from west to east. Hence, a portion of a 2.5 degree gridded input file should look something like the 
following:<P>

<B>Station</B> data files must be structured such that each column represents a different station, and each row represents the 
observed values for a given year. However, the first three rows must include the station name or label (maximum of 16 
characters with no space in the middle of a name of label), latitude and longitude, respectively, of each station, and must be 
preceded by the keywords "Station" (or "Stn"), "Latitude" (or "Lat"), and "Longitude" (or "Long" or "Lon"). The keywords are 
not case-sensitive, and so can be in upper, or lower, or mixed case. The first column of the data file must represent the year, 
listed consecutively beneath the keywords. (For applications in which the data do not represent years it would normally 
be appropriate to set this column to the record number.) Hence, a valid station input file should look something like the 
following:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
STN   STN_A STN_B STN_C STN_D STN_E STN_F
LAT    10.0  12.2  11.5   8.2   9.4  10.9
LONG   -1.0  12.3 -10.2   9.1  -5.3   8.4
1965   0.44  0.09  0.29  0.03  0.06  0.43
1966   0.18  0.34  0.81  1.96  1.09  0.51
1967   1.57  1.00  1.07  1.19  1.61  1.13
1968   0.77  0.99  0.35  0.76  0.52  0.29
</PRE>
<P>
<B>Unreferenced</B> data files are similar to the station data files, but do not have the first second and third rows, and use
the "Name" keyword (again not case sensitive) instead of the "Station" keyword. ("Year" and "Years" are acceptable alternative
keywords.) Thus, unreferenced data files should be structured such that each column represents a different series, and each row 
represents the observed values for a given year. The first row of the file should indicate the name of each series (maximum of 
16 characters with no space in the middle of a name of label). The first column of the data file must represent the year, listed 
consecutively beneath the "Name" keyword. (For applications in which the data do not represent years it would normally be 
appropriate to set this column to the record number.) Hence, a valid unreferenced input file should look something like the 
following:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
NAME      A     B     C     D     E     F
1965   0.44  0.09  0.29  0.03  0.06  0.43
1966   0.18  0.34  0.81  1.96  1.09  0.51
1967   1.57  1.00  1.07  1.19  1.61  1.13
1968   0.77  0.99  0.35  0.76  0.52  0.29

<P>
Since version 6 of CPT it is no longer permissible for the gridpoints, stations or series to run over to the following line.<P>
