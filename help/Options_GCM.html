<H2>GCM Options </H2>
CPT always interpolates from the X data to the Y grid or station locations rather than vice versa. The interpolation options 
provide alternative means of performing the interpolation. The interpolate option will use a linear distance-weighted 
interpolation of the four X values surrounding each Y grid / station.<P> 

The GCM data can be corrected for systematic errors using the model climatology options. The following options are available:
<UL>
<LI><I>No correction</I>: the raw model data are used, although an attempt will be made to convert the X to the same units as 
the Y data (see further details on the <A HREF="CPT_use03a_tags,html">cpt:units</A> tag);
<LI><I>Correct mean biases</I>: The mean of the GCM are forced to equal the mean of the Y data, although the correction is
performed in cross-validated mode, and so the mean bias may not be exactly zero;
<LI><I>Correct mean and variance biases</I>: The mean and variance of the GCM are forced to equal the corresponding values for 
the Y data, although the correction is performed in cross-validated mode, and so the mean bias and variance ratio may not be 
exactly zero;
<LI><I>Correct for skill</I>: A simple linear regression model is used to correct the GCM data. The mean bias will typically 
be close to zero (although not exactly zero, partly because of the cross-validation), but the variance ratio will tend towards 
zero as the skill reduces, and will generally be less than one.
<UL>

The model combination option is applied when the X file contains more than one model (see further details on the 
<A HREF="CPT_use03a_tags,html">cpt:model</A> tag). The following options are available:
<UL>
<LI><I>Average uncalibrated</I>: any corrections for systematic errors specified in the Model climatology panel are first 
applied to each model individually, and then a simple average across the models is calculated;
<LI><I>Average calibrated</I>: any corrections for systematic errors specified in the Model climatology panel are first 
applied to each model individually, a simple average across the corrected models is calculated, and mean and variance 
corrections to this model are then calculated (see the discussion above on mean and variance biases);
<LI><I>Average recalibrated</I>: any corrections for systematic errors specified in the Model climatology panel are first 
applied to each model individually, a simple average across the corrected models is calculated, and then this model average
is corrected for skill (see the discussion above on Correct for skill);
<LI><I>Skill weighted average</I>: a multiple regression model is used to combine the models;
<LI><I>Best model by location</I>: the model with the highest correlation with observed data is used. A different model may be 
selected for each location;
<LI><I>Best overall model</I>: only the model with the highest goodness index is used.
<UL>
