<H2>Making a Forecast</H2>
Before a forecast can be made, a file containing the values of the X variables to be used to make the forecast must be 
specified. The X input file is set as the default forecast file under the assumption that the latest data are stored in the 
same file as the historical data. However, it is possible to specify an alternative file and to adjust the default settings
for the years and the number of years to be forecasted. This file and its settings can be saved in the Project File so that
they are automatically set for next time. The input file is set using the browse button on the CPT Window. The file should be 
in an identical format to the X input file. Once specified, CPT will identify the first year of data available in the file, 
but you must define the first year of data to use to make a forecast. The number of forecasts to make should also be set. 
CPT will generate one forecast for each year of data it reads from the forecast data file. In most operational cases it will 
be appropriate to make only one forecast: a forecast for the target season from the current year's data.<P>

Once the forecast input file has been set, it is possible to generate and view the forecast(s) using the
<A HREF="Tools_Forecast.html">Forecast</A> option under the <A HREF="Tools.html">Tools</A> menu item. By selecting 
<A HREF="Tools_Forecast_Series.html">Series</A>, a Forecast Window will be opened, showing tables of the forecasts for 
individual gridpoints/stations/series and a graph of the historical and current forecasts. In the top left of the window, 
values of the upper and lower thresholds that define the three categories are indicated, together with the climatological 
probabilities and odds of each of the categories.  These values can be adjusted, as described later in 
<A HREF="CPT_use09.html">Customising the Results</A>.
 
Below the thresholds table, the forecasts table shows the year for which the forecast applies, the value of the forecast, and 
the forecast probabilities and odds for the three categories. These probabilities are derived from the prediction error of the 
forecast. The odds can be expressed relative to the climatological odds using the 
<A HREF="Options_Forecast.html">Options ~ Forecast Settings</A> menu item. If the normal category has the lowest probability and 
the categories are climatologically equiprobable, then the data for that station is probably not normally distributed. There 
is an option in CPT to transform the Y data to normal (see 
<A HREF="Options_Data_Transform.html">Options ~ Data ~ Transform Y Data</A>), although the low probability for the normal 
category may not always be resolved by selecting this option.<P>
 
The forecast ranges table indicates the year and forecast, just as in the forecast table, but shows upper and lower prediction 
intervals as alternatives to forecast probabilities for indicating forecast uncertainty. The confidence level for the 
prediction intervals can be adjusted, as described in <A HREF="CPT_use09.html">Customising the Results</A>.<P>
 
The graph shows the history of the cross-validated forecasts (green line) and observations (red line), and the current 
forecast(s) shown by green crosses. The forecast category for the unadjusted forecasts can be determined simply from the 
category divisions shown on the graph. The graph can be saved as JPEG files by right-clicking anywhere in the child window. A 
default name is given to the graphic file, but this name can be changed using the browse button. The quality of the JPEG file 
can be adjusted using the slider or by the quality indicator, which ranges between 0.01 and 1.00. The highest quality is 
obtained using 1.00. The size of the JPEG file is affected by the quality chosen, with larger files being generated the higher 
the selected quality. The image quality for all the graphics formats can be improved by increasing the size of the image (see 
<A HREF="Options_Graphics_GrphScaling.html">Options ~ Graphics ~ Graph Scaling</A>).<P>
 
By selecting <A HREF="Tools_Forecast_Maps.html">Map</A>, an option to view either the forecast values or the probabilities is 
given. The values map option provides a set of three maps (if the data are gridded or station) or bar charts (otherwise), one 
of which indicates the best estimate forecasts, and the other two indicate the lower and upper prediction intervals. The 
probabilities map option provides a set of three maps, each of which indicates the forecast probability for the three 
categories. The maps are shaded from blue for low  probabilities, to red for high probabilities. If more than one forecast is 
produced, the forecasts can be cycled using the up and down arrows (which will work better than attempting to type in the 
year). The maps can be saved individually as JPEG files by right-clicking anywhere in the child window, and then selecting the 
map to be saved. The titles of any of the maps or graphs can be customised by right-clicking in the child window and selecting 
<B>Customise</B>. The colour-scaling of the maps can be adjusted using <B>Customise ~ Contour Levels</B>.<P>

Forecasts can be saved using the <A HREF="File_OutputResults.html">File ~ Output Results</A> menu item. It is possible to save 
the forecast probabilities, odds, the actual forecast values and the prediction intervals.<P>
