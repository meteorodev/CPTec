<H2>Forecast Ensembles</H2>
Tables of an ensemble of forecasts for individual gridpoints/stations/series and a graph of the historical and current 
forecast(s) are shown. The table shows an ensemble of forecast values for the current variable and forecast target period.<P>

The ensemble is generated by defining equi-probable intervals between the forecasts, based on the cross-validated (by default) 
error distribution. The default number of ensemble members is nine, so that there is a 10% probability of the observed value
falling between and two sorted member, and a 10% probability of the observed value being larger than the largest member, and 
another 10% probability of it being smaller than the smallest member. The number of ensemble members can be reset using 
<A HREF="Options_Forecast.html">Options ~ Forecast Settings</A>), as can the method for calculating the error variance. The
retroactive and fitted error variances are alternative options.<P>

The graph shows the history of the cross-validated forecasts (green line) and observations (red line), and the current ensemble 
of forecast(s) shown by green crosses. The prediction intervals for the forecasts can be added by right-clicking on the graph,
and following the "Customize" option. The vertical coloured divisions show the three categories. Note that when calculating the 
cross-validated forecasts, the threshold defintions will have fluctuated slightly, and so the current categorization fo the
forecasts and observations may not exactly match the cross-validated classification. This fluctuation is the reason for any
apparent discrepancies between the graph and the <A HREF="Tools_Validate_Tables.html">contingency tables</A>.<P>

The forecasts can be saved by selecting the <B>Forecasts</B> tab from the <A HREF="File_Output_Results.html">File _Output 
Results</A>) menu. The graph itself can be saved as a BMP, EMF, GIF, JPEG, PCX, or PNG file by right-clicking anywhere in the 
child window and selecting <B>Export</B>. A default name is given to the graphic file, but this name can be changed using the 
browse button. The quality of the JPEG file can be adjusted using the slider or by the quality indicator, which ranges between 
0.01 and 1.00. The highest quality is obtained using 1.00. The size of the JPEG file is affected by the quality chosen, with 
larger files being generated the higher the selected quality. The image quality for all the graphics formats can be improved by 
increasing the size of the image (see <A HREF="Options_Graphics_GrphScaling.html">Options ~ Graphics ~ Graph Scaling</A>). The 
graphic title can be set using the <B>Customise</B> option upon right-clicking in the child window.<P>

The y-axis limits can be set by right-clicking on the image and then selecting the <B>Customise ~ Y-Axis Limits</B> option. The 
maximum and minimum values on the y-axis are indicated and can be reset. Resetting these axis limits will in turn automatically 
reset the tick-mark interval and number of tick marks. Greater flexibility for setting the tick marks is planned for future 
releases. Further options for customizing the graph, including adjusting the size of the fonts, and the size of the images, are 
available from <A HREF="Options_Graphics.html">Options ~ Graphics</A>.<P>
