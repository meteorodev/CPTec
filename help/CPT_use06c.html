<H2>Contingency Tables</H2>
Contingency tables can be obtained for the cross-validated forecasts, and if the retroactive forecast option was selected then 
tables for these forecasts are also available. Using the <A HREF="Tools_Validate_Tables.html">Tools ~ Validation ~ Contingency 
Tables</A> menu item, select whether it is the cross-validated or the retroactive forecasts that are to be analysed. In both 
cases a contingency table window will open.<P>

The contingency table window provides frequency and contingency tables for the forecasts. The frequency tables give the counts 
of forecasts for each of three categories, marked below-normal (B), normal (N), and above-normal (A), and the number of times 
each of the three catgories verified. Column totals are given showing the total numbers of times that each of the three 
categories were forecast/observed. The total number of forecasts is also provided, and for cross-validated forecasts should 
indicate the total number of cases available, as specified on the Input Window. The contingency tables indicate the 
percentages of times that each of the three categories verified given the forecast category, and can be obtained from the 
frequency tables by simply dividing each element in the table by the respective column total. The row totals on the contingency 
tables indicate the percentage of times that the observations were in each category, and should be identical on the 
variance-adjusted and unadjusted tables. The column totals on the contingency tables indicate the relative frquency with which 
the best-guess forecast was in each category.<P>

As with the validation statistics and graphs, scores and graphs are shown for one series at a time. Tables for the desired 
series can be shown by setting the appropriate number at the top left of the contingency table window. A series of that has 
been omitted in the calculations is skipped when cycling through the series using the arrows.<P>
