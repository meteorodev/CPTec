<H2>Forecast Probabilities </H2>
A set of three maps (if the data are gridded or station) or bar charts (otherwise) are shown. Each map indicates the forecast 
probability for the three categories. The maps are shaded from blue for low probabilities, to red for high probabilities. If 
more than one forecast is produced, the forecasts can be cycled using the up and down arrows, or typing in the year. The 
probabilities are derived from the best-guess forecast (the regression estimate from the CCA, PCR, or MLR model) by assuming 
that the errors in the best-guess forecast will be normally distributed (or, more strictly, will follow a Student's <i>t</i> 
distribution), with the variance of the errors defined by the variance of the errors in the cross-validated predictions 
(alternative error variances can be set using <A HREF="Options_Forecast.html">Options ~ Forecast Settings</A>). If the Y data 
have been <A HREF="Options_Data_Transform.html">transformed</A> it is assumed that the forecast errors of the transformed data 
will be normally distributed. From the best-guess forecast and the assumed error variance and distribution the probabilities of 
exceeding the various thresholds can be calculated.<P>

The maps can be saved individually or as a montage as BMP, EMF, GIF, JPEG, PCX or PNG files by right-clicking anywhere in the 
child window, and then selecting the desired graphic to be saved from the <B>Export</B> pop-up menu. A default name is given to 
the graphic file, but this name can be changed using the browse button. The quality of the JPEG file can be adjusted using the 
slider or by the quality indicator, which ranges between 0.01 and 1.00. The highest quality is obtained using 1.00. The size of 
the JPEG file is affected by the quality chosen, with larger files being generated the higher the selected quality. The image 
quality for all the graphics formats can be improved by increasing the size of the image (see 
<A HREF="Options_Graphics_GrphScaling.html">Options ~ Graphics ~ Graph Scaling</A>).

The map titles can be reset using the <B>Customise</B> option upon right-clicking in the child window. Similarly the 
<B>Customise ~ Contour Limits</B> option provides some flexibility to adjust the scaling on the colour bars. A window opens 
that indicates the assumed maximum and minimum probabilities when setting the scaling and number of colours. These values can 
be reset, which will in turn automatically reset the colour intervals and number of colours. Greater flexibility for setting 
the colour levels is planned for future releases. Further options for customizing the maps, including masking lakes or land 
areas, resetting the size of the fonts and of the image itself, are available from <A HREF="Options_Graphics.html">Options ~ 
Graphics</A>.<P>

The forecast probabilities can be saved from the <B>Forecasts</B> tab in <A HREF="File_OutputResults.html">File ~ Output 
Results</A>.<P>
