<H2>Tailoring</H2>
The <B>tailoring</B> options provide a number of ways of providing flexibility in how the forecasts are expressed. The 
standardization options provide different ways of comparing the forecast to a set of references, and of defining how the 
category thresholds are communicated. By selecting the "no standardization" option, the forecasts are expressed in the original 
units of the input Y data, but these can be converted to anomalies, standardized anomalies, standardized indices (suitable for
the Standardized Precipitation Index, SPI) or, if the <A HREF="Options_Data_Zero.html">Zero Bound</A> option is switched on, to 
percentage departures from average. If the % of average standardization option is selected, and the zero bound option is 
subsequently switched off, the standardization is switched off (a warning is provided). The forecasts, and saved data, and the 
category thresholds will be expressed in whichever standarization option is selected. The standardized indices option can be 
switched on or off after calculations have already been performed only if the calculations were performed with the 
<A HREF="Options_Data_Transform.html">Transform Y Data</A> switched on, and if the 
<A HREF="Options_Transform.html">Transformation</A> option was set to the gamma distribution. It is therefore best to select 
standardized indices before calculating results.<P>

The <B>tailoring</B> menu option also allows you to specify the prior probabilities of the above- and below- normal categories, 
or to use thresholds defined in physical values (mm, for example) instead, or to use previous years' observations. By default 
the prior probabilities are set at 33% so that the boundaries between the categories are the terciles of the climatogical 
distribution, but these probabilities can be reset, thus allowing probabilities for more extreme rainfall events to be 
calculated, for example. However, it should be noted that errors in estimating the thresholds for extreme events can become 
large, and so changes in the calculated probabilities may be inaccurate. If the absolute thresholds are set, and the lower 
threshold is set to be larger than the upper threshold, the two are swapped without warning. The values of the thresholds are 
assumed to be in the same units as the values of the (possibly standardized) Y input data. If the standardization option is set 
to "anomalies" and absolute thresholds are used, "below-normal rainfall could be set as 100 mm less than average by setting the 
lower threshold to -100. The reference year option sets the larger of the observed values for the two years as the threshold 
for the "above-normal" category, and the smaller as the threshold for the "below-normal category". Note that it is possible 
that the one year may represent the upper threshold for one location but the lower threshold for another location. This option 
is useful for answering questions such as "What is the probability that there will be more rainfall tahn last year?" Or "What 
is the probability that it will be colder than in 1980?"<P>
